# Decision-Support-System-for-Breast-cancer
This project, Decision Support System for Healthcare â€“ Breast Cancer, leverages machine learning techniques in R to build a robust predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis. Using algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), the system analyzes key diagnostic features to accurately classify malignant and benign cases. Cross-validation (CV) was employed to enhance model reliability and generalization. The project aims to support healthcare professionals with data-driven insights, improving early detection and decision-making in breast cancer management.
